1,Sometimes when my mom goes to work I still want to make contact with her so I say Skype is pretty awesome!!😄
0,Fam, I would give this 0 stars if I could. The update sucks and I can't send images without them being files.
1,Yes to Skype app. It means when you travel you can keep in touch. This is a great little app to add and keep.
0,Works horrible, connection is lost every 2 minutes. How is it possible that is not fixed after all this time?
1,I am from Poland and I am an old women so I,m very happy see my family and friends when I speaking this them.
0,Skype doesn't let you delete your account and the connection, as well as sound isn't as good as it used to be
1,i love skype it lets me talk to my daughter in cleveland and my sister in germany the best thing ever happend
0,There is no video input from caller. Only audio. Skype works fine on other devices, just not Kindle Fire HD.
0,The new update which moved from.bb world amazon store does not work.on BlackBerry z10 pls resolve the issue.
0,It does not work on my kindle hd 7. Unable to install it. Keep getting messages saying it is not compatible.
0,I give this app 1 star because I can't give it a zero... I was in the middle of a chat with my friend, which I could barley hear and my volume was all the way up. Another friend tried to call me, but I didn't answer it. Then skype kept making this annoying beeping noises. My friend could hear them on the other line. No one was calling me so I knew it was a glitch... after 5 minutes, I got sick of the noise. I closed skype ans restarted it. THE NOISE DIDN'T STOP! I forced stop the app... guess what... IT DIDN'T STOP!!! I finally gave up and deleted the app... IT. DIDN'T. STOP.... finally, after a few more minutes, the noise stopped. I went to go download skype again, but it made my whole kindle glitch. No all my friends are expecting calls that I can't give... FIX THIS PLEASE...
0,I can not Skype at all. Right in the middle of something important to this dying women, something that will never happen again and Skype started acting up, erased all contacts, won't let me sign in, even after I asked for Skype to send info on username and password to me, still wouldn't work. Then it tells me I have to pay to proceed, PAY? Since when? And still wouldn't even let me pay and continue video chat birthday party I was participating in. It kept bumping me of telling me I had to pay before looking at my settings without being logged in.. what's going on? Wouldn't even let me look at anything that was on the page, it would change then go back to PAY PAY PAY. I felt I was being extorted. I missed the party and now I fear they're mad at me cause they haven't returned my landline calls. I couldn't even get to help or customer service, kept diverting me to h home page of Skype or pay page. Terribly disappointed in Skype.
0,Whether or not it actually works varies from update to update. There are virtually zero adjustable call settings. It's hard to believe an app specially built for a single device can be so awful even YEARS after it was released. Skype for my junky phone works better than this.
0,I am using Fire phone now. Whenever I run skype, my 3G network drop and it seems the phone lost SIM. Then the UI get to lock screen and ask me to input SIM pin number. After I input the pin, the phone try to get the 3G network signal. And drop it again shortly. And ask me to key in pin number again. Only after I close Skype, it becomes normal. It takes me so long to find out it is skype which caused the problem. I had to turn off 3G network data usage in order to keep my phone staying normal for phone call before i found the killer.
1,This is the third time I have loaded skype on to my Blackberry Classic smart phone. The first 2 times it would not work and kept malfunctioning and causing my phone too many glitches so I uninstalled it. This time it is going better but I have noticed I have to sign out after I'm done on each call. Leaving the app running drains my battery quickly.
0,i have tried to use skype on both my fire kindles. the older 1st generation and the new HDX I just bought. The kindle fire itself is pretty amazing but I really had hoped to be able to use skype on it. I have been a skype user for 6-7 years and it has been great on my desktop and works great on my samsung galaxy S-3 but it's a no go on the fire. I have 2 Fires and 2 1st version monochrome monitor with the keyboards at the bottom. Streaming video on Fire is great with netflix, hulu or amazon prime which I bought when I got the Fire TV streaming device which is fantastic. The fire TV exceeded all my expectations but skype won't work on the Fire end of story. I have been trying with the older fire for over a year and now the new HDX i got a month ago it won't work either. It will not give you a dial pad to make calls. Don't waste your time with the skype until they do major updates just for kindle.
1,This new update is SOOOOOOOOOOOO much fun. I love the new filters for video messages and the short scenes from movies are just AWESOME! True only thing I don't like about this is that on your Skype home screen you can see all of your messages. I like that it does that, but.... it does not let your remove your history unlike before the new update. I honestly feel this is such a good app and video chat app just wish you could remove history. 😢
0,I started to use skype to talk to my besties, and it made my speakers and headphones stop working. Had uninstalled! Now, my kindle fire 7" doesn't have speakers or headphones, so its worthless. Please fix!
0,The "update" rendered Skype unusable for kindle. Its impossible to change your status from invisible, so your friends cant FIND you to add you. Searching for friends by Skype name OR email results in that friend not found, even if you are on the phone via voice and message exchanging that data. I gave up and took Skype off my kindle. It was a working program until they "improved" it. Don't bother. Pick a different messaging system.
0,Allow me to explain why, the update completely jumbles it and ruins it. It's somewhat buggy and glitchy and while it sort of works at first hand, there's a chance that you won't receive notifications AT ALL. And this is one of the issues. I tried the best I can and I couldn't get the notification to notify me. Now I have to check hours later or so to get to things. It's really unfortunate you can't receive notifications somewhat. By the way, this has less features than PC Skype so you can still use it, but it won't have most important stuff like a Video Group Call and such. Get it if you want but you'll be disappointed.
1,Jjj hkb gj :(fyfu jvf huh jhjhjh in gjchc zvkvj jcnvn hjggjg hjvv hm c.f. gb j :(gh hfjg hfj
1,Ok the is great but if u have had it kindle over a year it starts to glitch and stop working
0,Skype kills Kindle Fire in about 3 minutes. Tested and confirmed on two Amazon tablets
0,What is up with this app?it takes forever to download and I hate it just from that!
0,I hate this app..it drops calls like crazy.. and i usually cant hear the other person..i am so fed up with this app
0,I can't get the camera to work at all, even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. Complete waste of time and huge disappointment. Huge bug for them to fix.
0,It wanted me to PAY to make skype calls. The old one didnt. The update sucks.
1,It works so well with my kindle fire, well worth a down load thank you Amazon
1,It is the most also thing is what my dad told me so I am going to try it out
1,Works just as good as on my tablet ad pc. Use it on the Fire HDX and love it
0,It likely to occur a error like that: when I log in my account on skype( use kindle fire hd 7). If i log out then I can not log in again. I thought may be i forgot my password. But I have tried to recover my password and then try log in. But it still doesn't work!
0,Skype has always worked perfectly fine on my Kindle Fire, until the recent Kindle system update. Skype just prompts me that it is not compatible with my device anymore. Hopefully this gets resolved asap.
1,The video and audio quality on this device is excellent. Brief skype stalls or vid freezing c0,I recently downloaded Skype it worked fine for a while but now I can not even go onto the app. I click on it and my screen freezes or it loads for ever before the screen goes black or freezes
0,The Skype calls fail out of no where and I don't even know why. This really needs to be fixed because it's really annoying. I might just try to find a different app to use instead of this turd
0,Can't voice call on my kindle fair (3rd generation) this is horrible. I use it to talk to friends out of state and all I can do is message people. Fix it so it works on all kindle and phones.
1,Works great on my android phone! I can video chat as well. You must have a front facing camera for video chatting tho. But messaging is still fun & the emoticons are cute. Love Skype!!!
1,Works great, and the cost is a real bargain--free to call computers and a few pennies to call a phone number. And the sound quality is excellent, although the video quality is fair to good.
1,Enjoy skype very much can stay in touch with family that is way off. My only problem is I cannot get my camera to show me yet only my party I am talking to but will get it figured out soon.
0,When I got this game it was all good.But when I was on hear this morning and wanted to talk with my friend everything on here was gone!!! And I download Skype again just gone I was so mad!!
1,Downloaded the app to communicate with loved ones that do not live close and it works great. Recommend to anyone trying to keep in contact with loved ones and want facetime with them.
0,I specifically purchased a kindle fire hd because the Amazon and Skype sites said Skype works on a HD. It does not. Big waste of my time.
0,This worked great for a while now I'm having issues with viewing my profile. My video calls work well though I can't deny messages normally I have to use the return key to send a message.
1,I have been using for a very long time and have it installed on all my devices. I also use skype out. It works very nice. What I don't like I on skype out is that they lock your account if you don't use it regularly. This is why I give skype only 4 points. If skype changes this useless Locking I will change this to 5 stars.
0,I find skype on my kindle fire hd extremely glitchy. It crashes when I video call. It freezes. It seems to work fine on my friend's device. I love skype...... when it works.
0,I've had a terrible time using Skype in the past year that I've owned my Kindle. However, I recently removed and reinstalled the app and had a great uninterrupted long call with my mother this weekend. I hope this wasn't a fluke and is a sign that the app is making a comeback.
0,This app has changed a lot since being assumed by Microsoft. The settings and how they are adjusted are not clear. Also, adding addresses on Skype are not self explanatory
1,Skype works very well, and I can hear all of my friends clearly, but there is one problem. Skype said that there was an update, so I updated it, and then I tried going on again, but it still said there is an update. I looked again to see if there was another update, but it only said "open" instead of "update". Just to say, I have a kindle fire HD. If you know how to fix this problem, please tell me how to fix it.
0,This app is horrible not worth your time for it to download. Can't hear anything and the picture doesn't work for the person you are talking to because it is so delayed.
0,This is the most frustrating app I have ever used. I can video chat on average, 3-4 minutes before the call will drop. Unfortunately, that is only about a 3 of 10 on the frustration level that this app is about to take me on. After the call drops, I recall the person I was talking to only to get a black screen. I can't end the call, I can't back out of it, I can only wait until the app decides it is not working correctly and gives me an error message with the option to wait or end the app. Ending the app will take you back to the main page where you can either try and call the person back and repeat the black screen of Skype purgatory or exit the app completely. So after surviving Skype purgatory and fully exciting the app, you think, okay let's try this again. Maybe exiting the app has reset it and I can get another 3-4 minutes of video time. You enter the app, everything looks good, you dial and find yourself immersed back into blackness and understand that you are not in Skype purgatory but in the depths of Skype hell where no calls are ever made and you are doomed to relive the same horrors again and again. The only escape is to restart your system and stay far away from icy grips of Skype Lucifer. Heed the warning and flee from this app as it only brings darkness and gnashing of teeth.
1,Everytime i look at an app, i always look at reviews to determine if i get a certain app cause the review can be helpful. I saw many bad reviews for this due to its newest update? i had the app before a while back and it was soo crappy. terrible. After a long while, i decided to download it again and tried it. To my surprise, it works great and doesn't leave the call and is clear to hear the other person. Works great. I have the kindle.fire HD, but ive seen other reviews with the same tablet who had a lot of trouble though. Im glad it works perfect for me. I wish it would work great for others also! :/
0,I don't know why when I try to chat or something with someone specifically the application restart automatically and I can't comunicate with thai contact. I HATE IT!
0,Using a new KF-HDX (3rd kindle). Like many other reviewers - no incoming video. Have tried re-installing app a number of times with same results. Disappointed....
0,whenever I try to call my friend, it crashes! everytime it tell me to sign in, I have to go through this long process of fixing my password! at first it worked totally fine, and then it all of a sudden, it stops!
0,I recently tried to open skype and it told me there was an updated version. When I updated it and clicked on it again, it still denied me. I'm confused and unhappy. This is how I chat with friends
1,Skype is super fun and easy to use, I have seen the other reviews for the update and I heard that it ruined the whole thing. I haven't updated it so it works great! I would recommend not to update it. You can video chat all of your friends and you can also text them without paying for anything!
0,This app has good and bad qualities! :): the good qualities are, you can hang with your friends without "hanging with your friends", you can also message then too. Sadly, that's about it. :( now to the BAD qualities! >:-( sometimes it's a ####### piece of GARBAGE!!!!!!! It gave my kindle an awful virus!!! It also turns off on you when you are in the middle of a conversation!!! >:-( ### this thing SUCKS at times!!! If you want a REAL good version of Skype, go on the computer!!! This thing is a piece of #### at times. And believe it or not, but I never swer in my life!!! This thing makes people swear!!! >:-0
0,The app itself is pretty good, well, with the old update. I'm kind of interested in getting an updated version though. I mean like, 100% fully up to date with every other skype on phones and computers. Otherwise its pretty good.
0,Audio cracks, delays up to 20, echoes, and it doesnt connect, send notifications, or even give calls at times. not to mention the fact the call drops fifty times every time you call. horrible app, switching to google hangouts
0,The most recent update for skype makes the app crash to much and there are too many glitches. Otherwise its a decent app. If they don't fix the glitches soon though ill probably stop using it
1,I've had it for a while and got my friend to get it, and we are always video chatting to each other. It never crashes, except the video glitches a little here and there. I just wish that I could see the pics she sends me, and that there were more emojis.
0,The update... ugh I don't even. Whenever I call someone, and I turn up my volume all the way, my volume just automatically turns off. I have to turn it back up again. And you should really update it by giving an option of 'delete conversation'. I'd rather not have my friends brows0,I got Skype to talk to my friends but half the time it doesn't work, it hardly sends messages and the video chat makes my kindle shut off.
1,This app always comes in handy when I want to talk to my friends when I'm far away from them. I can video chat with them or message them.
1,I don't know why people are being such haters about this app. I think it's great. Exactly what the description says, no bugs or glitches.
1,Great for text, audio, or video calling to other Skype members with reasonable nation/international rates for calling non-members phones,
0,As a PC Skype user, this version should be Skype Lite. Disappearing for a usually good and a flexible app with many features...on my PC.
1,l have found that it is the cheapest and best way to communicate long distance and face to face. i.e.: : Canada to United States.
0,The image wasn't vey clear, signal was weak but that may have been the fault of my service. Facebook video chat is better in my opinion.
0,Skype used to be good. But this app is so bad. To many issues including video chat issues on which camera does not turn on. Bad bad bad!
0,The update just ruined it if you have an old version of skype keep it cause the new updated skype,.. it crashes almost all the time..=_=
1,I know everyone says the update is horrible...but it's okay. Not the best of updates but good. Other than the volume problems it's fine.
1,I'm just getting it and I now have quite bad feeling about it now :( :( :(
0,Please Fix! I wanna Skype people, but it's a horrible update! Please Sype!
1,Very good
0,It's okey
0,When I opened this it sent all my contacts a link to a virus. DO NOT USE
1,Love this app to stay connected to family.very easy to use and convenient
1,Mdidhjdjdsjskkdkdkdnn🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏇🏇🏇🎺🎻🏄🎼🎽🎵🎽🎼
1,This app lets me call mobile phones with my skype credit using my kindle.
1,Tends to drop every now an then. But when it's working good, it's great!
1,This is the most awsome app I can keep in touch with friends and family
0,would not download or work on my blackberry
1,Skype's good when you don't have face time.
1,Skype is Skype, you know what you gon' get.
1,No issues using app, everything works great
1,installed on my Fire tablet and works great
1,Skype is awesome it has really good quality
0,Couldn't figure it out. Not user intuitive.
1,The updated app is stable
1,It has been nice to Skype with my children
0,On BB 10 is not possible to send smileys.
0,Terrible update, along with frequently not making any notification that I have any messages waiting, it constantly crashes my entire tablet without warning and forces it to restart whenever I am checking my contacts, messages or even just trying to open the app. Don't use of you don't absolutely have to, try to find an .apk online of an.older version if you can.
1,I was a bit sketpical about Skype to be honest but when I had the first face to face talk with my family back in France in four years I was sold !!!! GET SKYPE ! It is amazing you can send docs music every thing its a phone as well as a video chat ! Get Skype !! I would rate it 100 stars if I could.!
0,My Skype app used to work perfectly until one update. After that, whenever I call a friend and I'm on too long it will give a loud noise only they can hear. Sometimes Skype won't even send messages until a day later or when I log in again. The app has gone through a lot of updates since and I hope it'll do better than it has been the past few months.
0,It was good for a few months, until it signed me out. I can't get my username right no matter how many users/passwords I've used before, and when I click &#34;can't sign in?&#34; nothing shows up. I'm only giving this a 3 star because it worked fabulously until it signed me out.
0,I want to stay in contact with many of God's children around the world .... an Skype was one way to see an talk.... but the video will not work on my kindle fire HDX... this is very upsetting.... Many people depending on open prayer, this is not a good way to run a company....Skype needs to fix there problems . So people that have spent money's on kindle fire HDX can do the work of the father..... the camera on the kindle fire is work I g just fine.... it's the Skype that's not connecting with the video to the kindle, fire HDX... So please Skype fix the glitches in your programs.
0,I have to say Skype has really gone down hill in recent months. Calls drop constantly. I even notice I'm seldom asked to rate the calls for quality anymore. However, it is still indispensable in my life. Can't imagine my life without it!
0,I like Skype on my computer, but this app is horrible. It's not compatible with Kindle Fire HD, no matter how you look at it. Not only does the app keep losing video and crash, it makes my device crash which is always terrifying because I never know if it'll ruin my Kindle forever. I uninstalled it from my device, and will not reinstall it until I hear it it once again compatible (if it ever is again). Until then, Oovoo is a much better and more reliable free video calling app.
0,Somebody text back because I'm just installing it but I already made me and account on my windows10 laptop before it crAshed hope this app works out😢😊💍💏💏👷🙋🏉💗😊👷😊😬🕜😇👷🍓🍓🐁😔💒😇😢💍💍💒💒💒💍🚕🚕😯😯😯💍🈲😊😬💍🈲😊
0,Dear skype: this new version lags so much, that it's impossible to text anyone. There is lag everywhere. In the photos, in the text, in the phone calls EVERYWERE it's the only thing I have to text with, so...........crap. don't download.
1,I bought a Kindle fire for my wife's parents that are visiting from Poland. We love to Skype daily with them including our 4 year old daughter. I hope they will be able to utilize it in Poland when they go back.
